      About Me
    </h1>
      <p> 
        My name is Cody Hennessey, 
        I am a senior at Florida Gulf Coast 
        University currently pursuing a BS in 
        Mathematics with a minor in Physics. My 
        main areas of focus are in Point Set 
        Topology, large scale Cosmology, and Algebraic 
        Topology in relation to grand unified theories 
        such as M-Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.
      </p> 
      <p>
        My short term goal is to pursue a Ph.D in 
        one of the fields listed above and then 
        research in said field. It would be an honor 
        to be able to contribute to both the Mathematics 
        and Physics communities in any form, for knowledge 
        is the greatest power a person (and society) can 
        have. 
      </p>

        The approach I have on problems in the field of Physics 
        (and hence mathematics as well) Is that of pure unbias. 
        This is of cours with the constrictions all humans have 
        on their perception of the world around them, but this 
        isnt a metaphysics discussion blog so I digress... 
        The principles some veterans in the feilds of General 
        Relativety and Qunatum mechanics may hold as concrete 
        fact, i still consider to be Theory. Well tested and 
        verified theory at that, but alas, still theory.  
        Similarly, I respect newer fields such as M-Theory and 
        Loop Quantum Gravity with similar consideration 
        (with slightly more skepticism of course) and am quite 
        interested in the extensive applications they could have 
        in the future.
